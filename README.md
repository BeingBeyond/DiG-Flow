<b>DiG-Flow</b> is a modular, plug-and-play design that provides general support for flow-matching based VLAs. It maps observations and predictions into a unified representation space and measures their distributional discrepancy, preventing the flow-matching expert from generating actions blindly and allowing the autoregressive foundation model to better leverage its pretrained knowledge. <b>DiG-Flow</b> is compatible with various VLA architectures, including <b>π</b>, <b>GR00T</b>, and <a href="https://beingbeyond.github.io/Being-H0" target="_blank"> <b>Being-H</b></a>.
